# Docker Ruby Node Postgres

**A docker image with Ruby, Node.js and PostgreSQL libraries.**

The goal of this image is to support Ruby and Node.js development with a PostgreSQL database without including unneeded dependencies such as MySQL libraries or Subversion, which are typically included in [buildpack-deps](https://github.com/docker-library/buildpack-deps), the base for the standard Docker images for Ruby and Node.js.
